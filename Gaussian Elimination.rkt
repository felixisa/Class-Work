;; Data Definitions

;; An SOE is a non-empty Matrix.
;; Constraint: for (list r1 ... rn), (length ri) is (+ n 1)
;; Interpretation: represents a system of linear equations
 
;; An Equation is a [List-of Number].
;; Constraint: an Equation contains at least two numbers. 
;; Interpretation: if (list a1 ... an b) is an Equation, 
;; a1, ..., an are the left-hand-side variable coefficients and b is the right-hand side
 
;; A Solution is a [List-of Number]
