; find-solution: board --> seq
; Purpose: To find a solution to the given board
; TERMINATION ARGUMENT: find-solution takes as input a single board and proceeds to create paths by creating the children
; of that board by exploring each possible move of the zero space. Then, the "best-path", or that whose first element has the smallest 
; manhattan distance, is selected as the most promising sequence and thus is explored first, avoiding uneccesary exploration of other boards.
; The children of this board are then added to the paths and the process of finding the most promising path is recursed, accumulating paths.
; On each recursive call, paths whose first element
; has been visited are ignored, avoiding the exploration of already explored boards.
; This also ensures an always finite number of boards, and as a a result, a finite number of paths that are explored.
; The function terminates when the best-path has eventually generated a child that is equal to the winning board.
