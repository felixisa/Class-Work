; Data Def
;  A board position, bpos, is a structure, (make-posn a b), where a and be are natnums

; Examples

(define P1 (make-posn 3 2))

(define P2 (make-posn 0 0))


; natnum --> (listof bpos) or false
; Purpose: To place n queens on a nxn board; otherwise return false
(define (place-queens n)
  (local (; natnum --> (listof bpos)
          ; Purpose: To returns a list of all the positions in a nxn board
          (define (total-board n)
            (for*/list [(i n) (j n)] (make-posn i j)))

          (define init-board (total-board n))

          ; bpos (listof bpos) --> (listof bpos)
          ; Purpose: To remove the positions in the given list that are
          ;          threatened by the given bpos.
          (define (rm-threatened a-bpos lob)
            (local (; bpos --> boolean
                    ; Purpose: To determine if the given bpos is threatened by a-bpos
                    ; Note: A bpos, target, is threatened by a bpos B if target and B
                    ;       are in the same column, in the same row, or if the difference
                    ;       between the xs is equal to the difference between the ys
                    ;       (i.e., target is on a diagonal from B).
                    (define (threatened? target)
                      (or (= (posn-x target) (posn-x a-bpos))
                          (= (posn-y target) (posn-y a-bpos))

          ; (listof bpos) natnum --> (listof bpos) or false
          ; Purpose: To place n queens in the given list of unthreatened positions
          ; Algorithm: If there are no unthreatened positions are left and there are
          ;            queens left to place, then there is no solution and return
          ;            false. Otherwise if there are no more queens to place, return
          ;            the empty list of bpos. Otherwise, try placing a queen in the
          ;            first unthreatened position and n-1 queens in the remaining
          ;            unthreatened positions. If it works, return the list with the
          ;            first unthreatened position and the solution for the n-1
          ;            queens else backtrack and try finding a solution using the
          ;            rest of unthreatened solutions.
          ;
          ; Termination: At each step, either or both the number of queens is
          ;              reduced by 1 and the remaining number of unthreatened 
          ;              positions is reduced. Eventually, either the number of
          ;              queens becomes 0 or the unthreatened positions  becomes
          ;              empty and the program terminates
